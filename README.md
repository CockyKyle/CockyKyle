- 👋  Hi, I’m Kyle Glover, a graduate from UCSC who majored in Computer Science
- 👀  I’m interested in programming/designing games, learning new algorithms, and AI!
- 🌱  I’m currently working on a game with one of my friends, and have started trying to learn and improve my existing programming skills while I volunteer for an FRC team (1458 Red Ties!!) 
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on mostly anything programming related, especially if it has something to do with games. Also currently looking for a job right now too, so there's that.
- 📫  You can reach me on Discord (CockyKyle#8951) or on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-glover-a581a9183/), plenty happy to meet new people and learn from them!
