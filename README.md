- 👋  Hi, I’m Kyle Glover, a graduate from UCSC who majored in Computer Science
- 👀  I’m interested in programming/designing games, learning new algorithms, and AI!
- 🌱  I’m currently working on a game with one of my friends, and have started trying to learn and improve my existing programming skills while I volunteer for an FRC team (1458 Red Ties!!) 
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on mostly anything programming related, especially if it has something to do with games. Also currently looking for a job right now too, so there's that.
- 📫  You can reach me on Discord (CockyKyle#8951) or on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kegloverslug), plenty happy to meet new people and learn from them!

So far....

  This my account has contributed mostly to college projects and assignments, many of which are AI focused. I also have been working on a game with a friend in Unity for the past year or so, though we had a hiatus for quite a long while due to personal problems that demanded most of our availability during that time period. Now though, we have the time to start working on it again, so here's hoping to some good, well-behaving code that doesn't break and a smooth design process!... Even though that never happens anyway......


UPDATE:
So I've been neglecting my GitHub.... a lot..... So expect the stuff here to be wildly out of date. I have the job search to worry about and most projects I'm working on right now are mostly just little one-offs and don't really need any form of version control. I might change that since I'm working away from my desktop now to make an office environment so I can be more productive with my time, so I might just keep the versions on GitHub so I can transfer between machines, but otherwise things might stay the same... Maintanence from one preson is hard :(
